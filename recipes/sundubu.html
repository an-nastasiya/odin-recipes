    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>What can possibly be better than a steaming hot cup of spicy soup on a winter day?
        We say nothing! That is why our second favourite for cold winter days is this Korean
        dish <strong><em>sundubu jjigae</em></strong>. It will fill you up and make you
        warm from the inside, just like looking at pictures of cats.
